# ‚ô£Ô∏è Blackjack game

## About this project

This is the second project I did for the Javascript course I'm taking at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), which I highly recommend, specially for those who are starting with Front-end development. 

It consisted of creating a simple interface to play Blackjack online.
